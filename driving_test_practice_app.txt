Title:
Exam Routes – Driving Test Practice App

Overview:
Exam Routes is a feature-rich driving test preparation app designed to help users practice using real-world driving test routes.<br><br>
I joined the project to modernize the codebase, implement a full UI overhaul based on provided Figma designs, fix bugs, and add new features like a quiz system with Firebase integration.<br><br>
This project strengthened my experience in working with existing designs, app refactoring, Firebase backend integration, and maintaining large-scale apps.<br><br>
