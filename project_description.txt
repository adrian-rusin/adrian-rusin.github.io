Title:
Google Map API App

Overview:
Food Nearby is a Flutter-based mobile application that helps users discover nearby restaurants using the Google Maps and Places APIs.<br><br>
The app retrieves a list of restaurants directly from Google Places, displaying them on an interactive map.<br><br>
This project served as a hands-on opportunity to refine my skills in Flutter development, state management, and location-based services.<br><br>
