Title:
Customizable QR Code Generator App

Overview:
This Flutter-based QR Code Generator App was a personal project built to strengthen my Flutter fundamentals and experiment with local storage and clean UI design.<br><br>
The app allows users to create QR codes for URLs, label them with a custom icon for easy identification, and save them locally.<br><br>
Itâ€™s a lightweight utility app with a focus on usability, organization, and clean interface design.<br><br>
